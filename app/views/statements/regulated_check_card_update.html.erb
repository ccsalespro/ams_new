    <h2>What are regulated check cards?</h2>
</center>
    <p><b>Several years back, the federal government passed the "Durbin Amendment" to regulate how much large banks could charge to process check cards.</b>  These "regulated check cards" have a very high per item fee of $0.22 but a very low percentage cost of 0.05%.

    <br><br>We are currently assumming that <b><%= number_with_precision(@statement.form_percentage, precision: 1) %>%</b> of your Visa, Mastercard Discover Volume or <b>$<%= number_with_precision(@statement.form_volume, precision: 0) %> comes in from these card types</b> based on other <%= @description.business_type_primary %> businesses in our database.

    <br><br>If a larger percentage of your transactions come from regulated check card transactions, <b>please adjust the percentage above</b> to allow us to create an accurate proposal.</p>
